  <h2> Samantha M. Brown <br/> An Aspiring User Experience and Social Impact Designer<br/> -- and a lover of all things cinematic.</h2>

  <p>Human behavior was my passion from the very beginning when I decided to major in Psychology (my undergraduate degree). I took a class in Web Design that piqued my interest in design that was long-since dormant (since high school in 2010-2012 when I learned Photoshop in Graphic Design courses). Wanting to help people was always my number-one goal.</p>

  <p>Fast forward into my Social Work degree, I concentrated in Management, which led me to the Social Entrepreneurship space where design, iteration, and prototyping are immersed within trying to solve social problems. I took a course called "Social Entrepreneurship" that was a bootcamp for coming up with impactful ideas using Design Thinking; then my course in Creating and Design for Entrepreneurship drew that process (Design Thinking) out in a semester-long project and I was hooked from there.</p>

  <p>User-Centered Design for Social Impact is my passion.</p>

  <p>In my free time, I'll be relaxing with my dog, Deja, and watching movies about supernatural things and sitcoms. I love to alternate between lattes, tea, and apple cider.</p>

  <p>You'll often find me engaged in community engagement projects at the School of Social Work at U-M or at the School of Information, trying to bridge technology with Change.</p>

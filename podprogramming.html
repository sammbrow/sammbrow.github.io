  <h1 class="entrytitle">POD Programming: Detroit Public Library Foundation</h1>
    <p>Fall 2018</p>
    <p>UMSI Alternative Fall Break</p>
    <p>Fall 2018</p>

  <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>A team of students traveled to Detroit for a two day design-jam-like session in which we worked with the Detroit Public Library Foundation to help them design programming for their satellite library locations, which were in the works for community outreach. These locations would exist within recycled shipping containers turned into small buildings known as "pods." Groups within our team split up to develop programming specific to the geographical area in which these pods would be placed. The programming we developed were relevant to the populations and business needs of the community in which they would be placed. Our final deliverable was a presentation on recommended programming as well as several design ideas for specific classes.</p>

  <h2>Role</h2>
    <p>Design Team Member</p>

  <h2>Skills + Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Powerpoint/li>

      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Team Management</li>
      <li>Leadership</li>
      <li>Interpersonal Collaboration</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

  <h2>Design process: Contextual Inquiry</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Empathy & Research: Understanding the Problem</li>
      <li>Brainstorming & Ideation: Define the Problem and Ideate Solutions</li>
      <li>Sketching: Draw Out Possible Solutions</li>
      <li>Prototyping: Create a Low-Fidelity Possible Solution</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Impact / Outcomes</h2>
    <p>After two days of intensive work, our team created a presentation of recommended programming for three library branch locations. It is our hope that the DPLF will be able to take these recommendations and repeat our research and iteration process to develop programming for the remaining library branches. Our research included understanding the geographical area and the population it included to create recommendations that were based in the populationâ€™s needs and preferences. The PODs will have incredible implications for access to needed services like Wifi, access to technology, and learning valuable skills through programming in the immediate Detroit area.</p>

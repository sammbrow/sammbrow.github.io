  <h1 class="entrytitle">Contextual Inquiry: Ferndale Parks & Recreation</h1>
    <p>Fall 2018</p>

  <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>A semester-long project where a team of students and me partnered with the Ferndale Parks and Recreation to address their needs in communication and outreach strategies within the community. We utilized a specialized interview technique aimed at understanding root causes and the context in which a problem is placed in order to develop recommended next steps. Throughout the semester my team has developed an interview protocol, conducted key-informant interviews, developed and synthesized an affinity wall (a qualitative data analysis method), and are currently working on our recommendations from our findings.  It is our hope that the organization will take these recommendations and implement them. These recommendations considered varying factors such as cost, feasibility, effectiveness, and time to implement.</p>
